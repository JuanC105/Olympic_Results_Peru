<h1 align="center" id="title">Peruvian Athletes at the Olympics: A Performance Overview (1936-2022)</h1>

<p id="description">This project focuses on analyzing the performance of Peruvian athletes in the Summer and Winter Olympic Games from 1896 to 2022. The analysis is conducted using Python for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical insights, complemented by Power BI for interactive dashboards. The goal is to explore various aspects of the athletes' participation, such as rankings, event performance, and historical trends, to provide a comprehensive overview of Peru's Olympic history</p>
  
<h2>⚠️ Limitations</h2>

The dataset does not include the results recently obtained in Paris 2024. Therefore, the bronze medal obtained in these last Olympic Games and other remarkable results are not included. In addition, there were some missing data regarding athlete names (e.g. volleyball teams) and some times achieved (e.g. Kimberly Garcia in Rio 2016). For this reason, it was not possible to analyse the number of athletes who attended each venue, but rather the participation in disciplines and events, whether individual or team.
